findArea
findCircumference 


Exercise 1: 
	Rectange is the "RectangeEntity" class 
	the above four functions are outside the class like c-functions 
	
	o object as call by value 
	o object as call by pointer 		| const pointer, pointer to const, const pointer to const 
	o object as call by reference 		| const reference 

Exercise 2: 
	Rectange is the "RectangeEntity" class 
	the above four functions are outside the class but in class "RectangleService" as static 
	
Exercise 3: 
	Rectange is the "RectangeEntity" class 
	the above four functions are inside the class as encapsulated functions 
	
	3.4 -> member functions of class defined outside 
	3.5 -> member functions of class defined inside 
	3.6 -> + const member function to process 'const object'
	
	o constructor - arg, no-arg(default), copy 
	o destructor
